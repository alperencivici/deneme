## 7. Design Challenges & Solutions

### 7.1 Fast Paced Combat in Confined Dungeon Spaces

**Challenge:**  
Designing a fast paced FPS and hack & slash combat system inside dungeon rooms creates a risk of players feeling trapped or overwhelmed, especially when facing large numbers of enemies in limited spaces.

**Solution:**  
This challenge is addressed by emphasizing **player mobility**. Dash and dodge mechanics allow rapid repositioning, while room layouts are designed with sufficient space for movement. Enemy aggression is balanced by giving the player strong movement tools, ensuring combat remains intense but fair.

---

### 7.2 Balancing Melee and Ranged Combat

**Challenge:**  
Combining melee hack & slash combat with ranged FPS mechanics can result in one combat style dominating the other.

**Solution:**  
Melee combat is designed as **high risk, high reward**, dealing greater damage at close range. Ranged combat provides safety but is limited by ammunition and reload times. This encourages dynamic weapon switching and situational decision making.

---

### 7.3 Roguelike Permadeath and Player Frustration

**Challenge:**  
A full permadeath system can discourage players if progress feels meaningless or overly punishing.

**Solution:**  
Progression within each run is designed to be **fast and impactful**, allowing players to feel noticeably stronger as they advance. Clear feedback through skill upgrades and combat improvements reinforces learning and mastery rather than frustration.

---

### 7.4 Enemy Density and Performance Stability

**Challenge:**  
High enemy density and aggressive AI behavior can negatively impact performance and visual clarity.

**Solution:**  
Enemy spawning is carefully controlled and AI behaviors are optimized for efficiency. Visual effects prioritize clarity over excess detail to ensure stable performance and readable combat even during intense encounters.

---

### 7.5 Replayability Without Persistent Progression

**Challenge:**  
Maintaining replayability without permanent upgrades between runs can be difficult.

**Solution:**  
Replayability is achieved through **procedural dungeon generation**, class variety, random enemy combinations and speedrun oriented performance tracking. Each run offers a new challenge and encourages optimization and skill improvement.
